# QAJavaProject - SkateXut

This is my final project for the QA Software Development Bootcamp. This project is a full CRUD functional api written in Spring. To demonstrate the Java skills learnt in the final weeks of the course.

SkateXut is designed to be a shop interface for Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting products. With attributes such as Barcode, Name, Colour, Dimentions, Descriptions. Which will store persistent values using H2 database. This information can be relayed via the Java/SpringBoot backend. With a .jar included. Which can be run locally, and make use of port 8080 to be used for API - Requests can be made via Postman, screenshots provided below
